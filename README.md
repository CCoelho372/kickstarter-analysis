# Kickstarter Challenge

## Overview of the Project
Louise's first play 'Fever' came close to accomplishing its fundraising goal on Kickstarter. She is still highly motivated to get the play funded and launched. This time Louise would like to look at other areas of the data to help her make a successful fundraising campaign. In this analysis Louise will be targeting 2 specific areas: theater outcomes based on launch date and fundraising goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

One way to determine success of a campaign is based off of launch date. While evaluating the Kickstarter Campaign data, the most successful times to have a launch date is from May to July. These are the only 3 months in which the number of successful campaigns rises above 75. Another area to consider is that the range of failed campaignes remains consistent between 33 and 52 campaigns a month throughout the year. When the failure stays mainly consistent it is good to identify when the most successful months are for a campaign.


#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

A second approach to determine success is based on percentage of success due to the goal amount. When reviewing the kickstarter campaigns that have been successful in the past, having a goal between $0 and $14,999 or $40,000 and $44,999 shows to have a success over 50%. To have the best success in reaching your goals it would be ideal to stay within these ranges. The fail rates rise over 60% with goals between $25,000 and $39,999.
 
 #### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
 During the analysis there were not many difficulties putting the data together. With this analysis the areas of difficulty can arise from formulas being created to determine percentages of success by month and category. Each time additional criteria is added to formulas there is an increased risk for selecting the wrong variables or inputting the incorrect "IF" statements and requirements.
 
#### Limitations
This Kickstarter data set has valuable information for a 8 year period, 2009 to 2017. As we continue into 2021 if Louise wanted to start a campaign now it would be important to included campaign outcomes and success since 2020 began. As the pandemic has effected everything in our lives there is a good chance that it has also effected campaign outcomes for plays. In addition, this is one data set from one campaign funding source. It would be important to determine what other approaches, either website or service, could be used to raise money. Then determine if outcomes have the same trend in those services. For example, are there some fundraising websites that may be better if Louise wanted to fundraise for a play over $50,000.  Is there a way to have a campaign to be more successful in the winter months so plays could be performed in summer months?  By getting more recent data to assess pandemic effects and data from other sources Louise can narrow down her focus to have a successful campaign for her play. 

#### Recommendations
 If this is the only data that is available for Louise some other areas to assess would be combining outcomes with launch data and goals. This may be a good way to see if there are certain times of the year when goals are more successful. For further analysis it would be helpful to assess not just outcomes but amount of money raised compared to the goal. You may be successful in your goal for the play by setting higher goals. If campaigns are consistent on raising a percentage of the goal it may be good to have a goal a certain level above how much you need. Successful or not on the kickstarter campaign site it may be successful in getting the play created and developed.
